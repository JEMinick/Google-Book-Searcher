## Description: 

The primary motivation for creating the google-book-searcher was to refactor an existing RESTful API into a GraphQL API built with the Apollo Server.<br><br>
The problem being addressed and resolved with this app is to modernize a RESTful API and transition into a MERN stack GraphQL API.<br><br>
By creating this app, I learned the MERN stack that: <br>
* uses the MongoDB on the database end, 
* the React library on the front-end, and 
* the NodeJS and Express libraries providing server services.
